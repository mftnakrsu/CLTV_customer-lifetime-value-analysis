# Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Calculation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) using the provided formulas.

## Step 1: Data Collection

To calculate CLTV, you will need the following data:

- Total Price: The sum of all transaction values.
- Total Transaction: The total number of transactions.
- Total Number of Customers: The total number of customers.

## Step 2: Calculating Customer Value

-  Customer Value is calculated using the following formula:

```
Customer Value = Average Order Value x Purchase Frequency
```

- Average Order Value: Calculated by dividing the sum of all transaction values by the total number of transactions.

```
Average Order Value = Total Price / Total Transaction
```

- Purchase Frequency: Calculated by dividing the total number of transactions by the total number of customers.

```
Purchase Frequency = Total Transaction / Total Number of Customers
```

## Step 3: Calculating Repeat Rate and Churn Rate

Repeat Rate is the ratio of customers who make multiple purchases to all customers:

```
Repeat Rate = Number of Customers Making Multiple Purchases / Total Number of Customers
```

Churn Rate is the complement of Repeat Rate:

```
Churn Rate = 1 - Repeat Rate
```

## Step 4: Determining Profit Margin

Profit Margin is defined as 10% of the Total Price:

```
Profit Margin = Total Price x 0.10
```

## Step 5: Calculating CLTV

Finally, CLTV is calculated using the following formula:

```
CLTV = (Customer Value / Churn Rate) x Profit Margin
```

This step-by-step guide provides a detailed explanation of how to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV). These calculations can help your business develop personalized marketing strategies and revenue forecasts.
